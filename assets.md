# Assets

Images, documents, and other website assets can be managed via the BoomCMS Asset Manager.
Site assets are inserted into pages via the Asset Picker which provides a more simplified interface for uploading and browsing assets.
Both the Asset Manager and Asset Picker are available to users who have the **manage_assets** role.
