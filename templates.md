# Templates

Templates control the visual representation of the page and what functionality is available.

The template is changed via the 'template' section of the page settings menu.
When a page's template is changed a new [page version](/pages.html) is created and the change must be published before it is visible on the site.

Within the template developers can define editable chunks of content.
For more information about chunks and how they are defined see the [chunks page](/chunks.html).

## Themes

Templates can be grouped and packaged as part of a theme.
Themes provide a way to easily extend and customise a BoomCMS site.
