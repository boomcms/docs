# Page versioning

This page outlines the key concepts behind page editing an versioning in BoomCMS.

## Visibility

Whether or not a page appears on the site can be controlled with the page visibility settings.

A page can be visible (appears on the site) or invisible (can only be viewed when logged in via the CMS).
When a page is set to be visible a time at which it becomes visible and a time when it ceases to be visible can be set via the visible from and visible to settings.

After creation a page is invisible until the editor changes the page visibility settings to make it visible.

## Versioning

Whenever the content of a page is edited a new version of the page is created.
Initially this version will only be visible in the CMS with the unedited content staying on the live site.

There are three options for making page edits live which are available from the page drafts section of the settings menu.

* Publish
* Embargo
* Request approval

Publishing the changes makes them appear on the site immediately but requires that the logged in user be given permission to publish changes.

Embargoing changes allows setting a time at which the changes will appear on the site.
This should not be confused with page visibility which affects the page as a whole rather than a set of page edits.

Requesting approval is available for users who don't have permission to publish changes directly and allows the changes to be marked as awaiting publication for approval by someone with permission to publish changes.

If a page is set to be invisible then it will need to be made visible before published changes will appear on the site.
